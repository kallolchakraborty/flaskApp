# The file is an application deployment descriptor. This means that it contains information needed to deploy 
# the application on cloud doundry e.g. name of the application, path to the application, etc.

# It is not needed. The file is optional. Although using the file is helpful so that we don't 
# have to give the application name, path etc in the cli command when deploying the file every time. 
# The cf push command looks for a manifest.yml file in the directory from where the push command is 
# executed and uses the deployment values from this file.
